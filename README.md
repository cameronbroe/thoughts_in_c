# Thoughts in C

## Description

Random thoughts and scribblings I have all written in C.

## Scribbles

[fast_rgba_to_bgra](fast_rgba_to_bgra/) -> Experimenting with bitfields for "simple" RGBA->BGRA and back conversions using as little memory as possible

[usbmuxd_list](usbmuxd_list/) -> A simple program to connect to usbmuxd and list all currently connected devices

[usbmuxd_monitor](usbmuxd_monitor/) -> A simple program that prints to stdout when an iOS device is connected/disconnected using usbmuxd
